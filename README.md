Overview

This repository contains a full Density Functional Theory (DFT) workflow for studying the structural, electronic, and mechanical properties of primitive α-B₆O, a superhard boron-rich ceramic.

The project was performed using the VASP simulation package with post-processing using VASPKIT, VESTA, and pymatgen.
It includes:

Structural relaxation

Static SCF calculation

Density of States (DOS)

Band structure

Elastic constants (Cᵢⱼ)

Mechanical moduli (B, G, E, ν, Debye temperature)

Why Study B₆O?

Boron suboxide (B₆O) is one of the hardest known materials, with:

Exceptional mechanical stiffness

High thermal stability

Strong B–B and B–O covalent bonding

Low density

Resistance to extreme conditions

Understanding B₆O at the first-principles level helps explain:

Origin of its superhardness

Bonding characteristics

Electronic behavior

Mechanical stability
